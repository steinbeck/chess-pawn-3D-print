# 3D printing a replacement for a lost chess pawn
A dear friend had lost one of his chess pawns from a chess set that he had since his youth. I set out to create a 3D-printed replacement using a photo of one of the leftover pawns. Here is a little making-of video of how it worked out. Not really a true how-to, so please contact me if you want details.
