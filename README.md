# 3D printing a replacement for a lost chess pawn
A dear friend had lost one of his chess pawns from a chess set that he had since his youth. I set out to create a 3D-printed replacement using a photo of one of the leftover pawns. Here are the file used and created during the project. Not really a tutorial, so please contact me if you want details.
